My project is a Photo Booth Page. I had this small hobby/business pre-covid.
The 1st CSS features I included was a navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes. The navigation menu uses a Hamnurger menu with About, Packages we offer and Our Contact information.
The 1st javascript Feature I chose was to create a form, I chose to create a contact form with the name and email feature a required field and the phone number, events notes and event type fields as optional. If they enter there name and phone it will prompt them to enter an email address to move forward. The 2nd Javascript feature I chose was to make a photo gallary that hides the photos until you click through the gallery on the main page.
