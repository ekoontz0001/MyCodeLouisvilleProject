My project is a Photo Booth Page. I had this small hobby/business pre-covid.

The 1st CSS features I included was a navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes using a hamburger menu. I added a media querie @600px The Hamburger moves and becomes a drop down menu. 

The 1st javascript Feature I chose was to create a form, I chose to create a contact form with the name and email feature a required field and the phone number, events notes and event type fields as optional. If they enter there name and phone number it will prompt them to enter an email address to move forward. 

The 2nd Javascript feature I chose was to make a photo gallary that hides the photos until you click through the gallery on the main page. 



Media Query: 

(1)I added a media query @600px The Hamburger menu moves to center and becomes a drop down menu. The menu items move from the top to the drop down menu by clicking the hamburger menu.
(2) Photo Booth Company & Contact Form Changes from black to red at 768px
